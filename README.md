# Regression Project

QMBE 3730- Advanced Business Analytics

Description of Project
You will work with your group to analyze the data in your dataset using the tools that we have learned in this course. 

The goal of this project is to develop a meaningful model of the relationships between some of the variables in your dataset. 
Specifically, you will create a regression model that can be used to predict one variable based on the values of other variables. This process will follow the steps
outlined below. You will likely complete some analysis (e.g., create some graphs, and estimate
some regressions) that will not show up in your final project. Think carefully during each step
about which information is valuable to include in your final report and which is not. 

In other words, don’t include everything you can do just because you can do it. Ultimately, you are striving to
develop a coherent story based on your analysis and clearly conveying that story is as important
as completing the analysis correctly. You will likely need to iterate through many of the
assignment steps multiple times.
To ensure that your assignment is complete and that you earn as many points as possible, please
carefully read this entire document including the prompts in the Assignment Steps, the
description of Deliverables, and the Grading Rubric.
